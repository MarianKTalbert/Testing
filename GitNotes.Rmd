## Why use Git
- Reproducible Research
- keeping code organized
- collaborating with others
- backing up work (on hosting servicies like GitHub and Bitbucket)
- harder to loose work (if Git is used correctly)
- freedom to experiment 
- understanding when errors were introduced into code (and who introduced them)
